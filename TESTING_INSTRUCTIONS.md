# Testing Route Optimization Fix

## What Was Changed:
1. âœ… Changed "assignments" to "requests" in all UI text
2. âœ… Removed the 8 "Available" items from Route Items section  
3. âœ… Added detailed debug logging to track database updates

## Test Steps:

### Step 1: Clear Cache and Refresh
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab â†’ Storage â†’ Local Storage
3. Find and delete the `force_cache_reset` key (if it exists)
4. Add a new key: `force_cache_reset` with value `true`
5. Refresh the page

### Step 2: Go to Request Page
1. Click on "Request" tab at the bottom
2. Click on "Available" tab
3. You should see available requests

### Step 3: Accept a Request (WITH CONSOLE OPEN)
1. Keep DevTools console open to see logs
2. Click "Accept" on ANY available request
3. **WATCH THE CONSOLE** - you should see:
   - `ðŸ”„ Accepting request [id] as pickup_request`
   - `ðŸ‘¤ Collector ID: [your-id]`
   - `ðŸ“¦ Using requestManager.acceptRequest()...`
   - `ðŸ“Š RequestManager result: {success: true/false, error: ...}`

### Step 4: Check Route Optimization
1. After accepting, click "Routes" tab at the bottom
2. You should see:
   - "No accepted **requests** to optimize" (not "assignments")
   - The request you just accepted should appear in the Route Items section
   - Map should show the request location

## What to Share:
Please share the FULL console output from Step 3, especially:
- The RequestManager result
- Any error messages
- Whether it succeeded or failed

This will tell us exactly why the database update is failing.
