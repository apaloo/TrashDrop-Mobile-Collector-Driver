## 🧪 5-Minute Test Script

### Test 1: Authentication Persistence
```bash
✓ Open http://localhost:5173
✓ Login as collector
✓ Navigate to Earnings
✓ Should NOT see "Authentication required"
✓ Refresh page
✓ Should still be logged in
```

### Test 2: Legacy Request Breakdown
```bash
✓ Go to Requests page
✓ Click "View More" on any request
✓ Should see "Estimated Payout Breakdown"
✓ Should show "Estimated" badge
✓ Should show Base Payout (87% of total)
✓ Should show Potential Bonuses (13% of total)
✓ Total should match ₵X.XX in main display
```

### Test 3: Currency Formatting
```bash
✓ All amounts show currency symbol (₵, $, etc.)
✓ All amounts have 2 decimal places
✓ No "NaN" or "undefined" values
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Breakdown Not Showing
**Symptoms:** Click "View More" but only see "Additional request details..."

**Fix:**
```bash
# Dev server needs restart
npm run dev
# Then refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+F5)
```

### Issue 2: "Estimated" Not Showing
**Cause:** Request has `collector_core_payout` field

**Expected:** This is correct! It shows actual breakdown instead

### Issue 3: Wrong Currency Symbol
**Check:** Currency context is properly configured
```javascript
// In useCurrency hook
const { currency } = useCurrency(); // Should return 'GHS', 'USD', etc.
```

## 🎯 Support Quick Answers

### Q: "Why does it say 'Estimated'?"
**A:** "For older pickup requests, we show an estimate. Once you accept, we calculate your exact earnings based on your location and current bonuses."

### Q: "Will I get the exact amount shown?"
**A:** "The estimate is usually 90-95% accurate. Your actual payout is calculated when you accept the request."

### Q: "How do I earn more bonuses?"
**A:** "Work during peak hours (surge times), accept urgent requests, and maintain a high collector rating for loyalty bonuses."

### Q: "What's the difference between Base and Bonuses?"
**A:** "Base is your guaranteed minimum. Bonuses are extras for things like distance, urgency, and surge pricing."
